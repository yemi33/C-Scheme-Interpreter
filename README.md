# C-Scheme-Interpreter 

## Introduction

This is a C-program that interprets Scheme code!
This was a course final project for Programming Languages and Design course at Carleton College. It is one of the more recent projects of mine. 

## How to Run the Program

1. Make a `myprog.scm` file in the main folder, and put some Scheme code in it.
2. Type `make` in the command line.
3. Type `./interpreter < myprog.scm` in the command line.
4. See the results of the interpreted Scheme code in the terminal!

## Error Checking

To check for memory errors, type `valgrind ./interpreter < myprog.scm` in the commandline.
